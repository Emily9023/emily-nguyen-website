        <p>As a lifeguard/swimming instructor, I am responsible for maintaining safety in the 
          facility and for providing high-quality in-water swim lessons for all ages, including 
          students with special needs. I keep clients safe, I am required to maintain my training 
          to handle emergency situations.
          I have learned to identify and resolve problems efficiently and communicate effectively 
          to build strong interpersonal relationships. Due to the demands of my job, I provided 
          quality customer service by always positively interacting with my clients to build 
          relationships and trust. My exposure to a variety of different ages has allowed me to 
          gain experience effectively communicating to accommodate a variety of different people. 
          In addition, I gained experience working with a team to identify and minimize hazards 
          within the environment through creative problem solving and critical thinking.</p>,

        <p> The Blue Sky Solar Racing team is a student-led design team that constructs 
          and designs solar-powered vehicles. The team encompasses a variety of diverse 
          talented students comprising of 7 subteams, I am a member of the mechanical 
          subteam. The team provides attention to design sustainable vehicles and 
          delivers valuable technical training that bridges theoretical knowledge from 
          schooling to practical hands-on experience. 

          As a member, I help in designing parts for the car as well as running 
          simulations to ensure that the parts are safe. As a team member, I am 
          required to use CATIA, a CAD software, to provide a 3D modeling prototype 
          of the part. Using ANSYS, I run simulations on the part to check if the part 
          is able to withstand the force load with acceptable safety. In my role, I have 
          designed the braking system aswell as clevises.

        <p> The Concrete Toboggan is a student-led design team that designs and builds a 
          concrete toboggan. The toboggan is raced against toboggans all over Canada, 
          testing for speed, steering and braking as well are spirit-sided components 
          such as theme design. 

          As a costumes lead, I am required to design, order, and manufacture 30 
          costumes that represent the theme of the concrete toboggan. This role is 
          important to create a sense of spirit and cohesion within the team. Aside 
          from my delegations as a spirit lead, I am fully immersed in the work of the 
          design side; I partake in design lead meetings, providing input and help 
          design and brainstorm for the concrete toboggan.
